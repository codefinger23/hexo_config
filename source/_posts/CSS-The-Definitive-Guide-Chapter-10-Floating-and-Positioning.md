## Floating

The additions to you ALIGN options need a lot of explanation. First, the values "left" and "right". Images with those alignments are an entirely new floation image type.

float

- Value: left | right | none | inherit
- Initial value: none
- Applies to: All elements
- Inherited: No
- Computed value: As specified

The Details Floating

1. The left (or right) outer edge of a floated element may not be the left (or right) of the inner edge of its containing block.
2. The left (or right) outer edge of a floated element must be to right (or left) of the right (left) outer edge of a left-floating (or right-floating) element that occurs earlier in the document's source, unless the top of the later element is below the bottom of the former.
3. The right outer edge of a left-floating element may not be to the right of the left outer edge of any right-floating element to its right. The left outer edge of a right-floating element may not be to the left of the right outer edge of any left-floating element to its left.
4. A floating element's top may not be higher than the inner top of its parent. If a floating element is between two collapsing margins, it is placed as though it had a block-level parent element between the two elements.
5. A floating element's top may not be higher than the top of any earlier floating or block-level element.
6. A floating element's top may not be higher than the top of any line box containing a box generated by an element that comes earlier in the document source.
7. A left (or right) floating element that has another floating element to its left (right) may not have its right outer edge to the right (left) of its containing block's right (left) edge.
8. A floating element must be placed as high as possible.
9. A left-floating element must be put as far to the right as possible. A higher position is preferred to one that is further to the right or left.

clear

- Values: left | right | both | none | inherit
- Initial value: none
- Applies to: Block-level elements
- Inherited: No
- Computed value: As specified

## Positioning

You can choose one of four different types of positioning, which affect how the element's box is generated, by using the position property.

position

- Values: static | relative | absolute | fixed | inherit
- Initial value: static
- Applies to: All elements
- Inherited: No
- Computed value: As specified

The containing block

- The containing block of the "root element" is established by the user agent.
- For a non-root element whose position value is relative or static, the containing block is formed by the content edge of the nearest block-level, table cell, or inline-block ancestor box.
- For non-root elements that have a position value of absolute, the containing block is set to the nearest ancestor that has a positon value other than static.
- If there are no ancestors, the element's containing block is defined as the initial containing block.

top, right, bottom, left

- Values: <length> | <percentage> | auto | inherit
- Initial value: auto
- Applies to: Positioned elements
- Inherited: No
- Percentages: Refer to the height of the containing block for top and bottom and the width of the containing block for right and left.
- Computed value: For relatively positioned elements, see the following Note; for static elements, auto; for length values, the corresponding absolute length; for percentage values, the specified value; otherwise, auto.
- Note: The computed values depend on a series of factors; see individual entries in Appendix A for examples.

mmin-width, min-height

- Values: <length> | <percentage> | inherit
- Initial value: 0
- Applies to: All elements except nonreplaced inline elements and table elements
- Inherited: No
- Percentages: Refer to the width of the containing block
- Computed value: For percentages, as specified; for length values, the absolute length; otherwise, none.

max-width, max-height

- Values: <length> | <percentage> | none | inherit
- Initial value: none
- Applies to: All elements except nonreplaced inline elements and table elements
- Inherited: No
- Percentages: Refer to the height of the containing block
- Computed value: For percentages, as specified; for length values, the absolute length; otherwise, none

overflow

- Values: visible | hidden | scroll | auto | inherit
- Initial value: visible
- Applies to: Block-level and replaced elements
- Inherited: No
- Computed value: As specified

clip

- Values: rect(rop, right, bottom, left) | auto | inherit
- Initial value: auto
- Applies to: Absolutely positioned elments
- Inherited: No
- Computed value: For a rectangle, a set of four computed lengths representing the edges of the clipping rectangle; otherwise, as specified.

visibility

- Values: visible | hidden | collapse | inherit
- Initial value: visible
- Applies to: All elements
- Inherited: Yes
- Commputed value: As specified

z-index

- Values: <integer> | auto | inherit
- Initial value: auto
- Applies to: Positioned elements
- Inherited: No
- Computed value: As specified

## Summary

Floating and positioning are very compelling features of CSS. They're also likely to be an exercise in frustration if ou're careless in how you use them.
