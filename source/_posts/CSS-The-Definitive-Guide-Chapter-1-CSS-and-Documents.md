> Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) are a powerful way to affect the presentation of a document or a collection of documents.

## The Web's Fall from Grace

HTML was originally intended to be a structural markup language, used to describe the various parts of a document; very little was said about how those parts should be displayed. The language wasn't concerned with appearance——it was just a clean little markup scheme.

As a result of many difference style pressures, markup elements like &lt;font&gt;and&lt;big&gt; started to creep into the language. Suddenly, a structural language started to become presentational.

## What a Mess

- Unstructured pages make content indexing inordinately difficult.
- Lack of structure reduces accessibility.
- Advanced page presentation is possible only with some sort of document structure.
- Structured markup is easier to maintain.

## CSS to the Rescue

- Rich Styling
- Ease of Use
- Using Your Styles on Multiple Pages
- Cascading
- Compact File Size
- Preparing for the Future

## Elements

Elements are the basis of document structure.

- Replaced and Nonreplaced Elements
- Element Display Roles

## Bringing CSS and XHTML Together

The structure is an inherent part of the relationship between XHTML and CSS; without the structure, there couldn't be a relationship at all.

There some various ways that document connects to CSS:

- The link Tag
- The style Element
- The @import Directive
- Actual Style Rules
- CSS Comments
- Inline Styles

## Summary

With CSS, it is possible to completely change the way elements are presented by a user agent(generally browers). This can be executed at a basic level with the display property, and in a different way by associating style sheets with a document.
