## Numbers

There are two types of numbers in CSS: integers("whole" numbers) and reals(fractional numbers). These number types serve primarily as the basis for other value types, but, in a few instances, raw numbers can be used as a value for a property.

## Percentages

A percentage value is a caculated real number followd by a percentage sign (%).Percentage values are nearly always relative to another value, which can be anything, including the value of another property of the same element, a value inherited from the parent element, or a value of an ancestor element.

## Color

- Named Colors
- Colors By RGB: Functional RGB colors and Hexadecimal RGB colors. Web-safe colors.

## Length Units

These length units are divided into two types: absolute length units and relative length units.

### Absolute Length Units

- Inches(in)
- Centimeters(cm)
- Millimeters(mm)
- Points(pt)
- Picas(pc)

### Relative Length Units

- em-height(em)
- x-height(ex)
- pixels(px)

## URLS

By absolute, a URL that will work no matter where (or rather, in what page) it's found, because it defines an absolute location in web space.

## Keywords

For those times when a value needs to be described with a word of some kind, there are keywords.

## CSS2 Units

- Angle values
- Time values
- Frequency values

## Summary

Units and values cover a wide spectrum of areas, from length units to special keywords that describe effects(such as underline) to color units to the location of files (such as images).
